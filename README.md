# Sonada (Meetup Clone)

# Premise 

Sonada was meant to be a platform that allowed for users to create groups that shared similar interests or just wanted to pursue something new. As someone who's inherently introverted and not really someone who takes initiative in meeting/talking to people outright; having groups that kind of did a bit of the legwork in a manner of speaking by at least connecting you with others. (Similar to how texting is considered easier for people). However; unlike simply texting; events can be planned for individual by individuals in the group. No pressure for an individual to have to feel like they have to be commited to joining and can join at their own leisure/availability.
